<b>List of algorithms: </b>

1. Counting sort 

2. Radix sort


<b>Points to remember:</b>

1. Counting & radix sort are the algorithms which have same best, worst and average case complexities.

2. Key measuring factors measuring efficiency of an algorithm are time and space.

3. Time complexity is measuring the efficiency of an algorithm by counting the number of key operations.

4. Space complexity is measuring the efficiency of an algorithm by counting maximum memory needed by algorithm.


<b>Formulas :</b>

1. Sum of powers of any integer n

	xˆ0 + xˆ1 + xˆ2 + xˆ3 + xˆ4 + .....+ xˆk = (x ^ (k+1) - 1) / (x -1)

2. Sum of numbers from 1 to n

	1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ..._+ n = (n * (n+1)) / 2

3. log_k(n) = k raised to what power would equal n.

4. Sum of first x powers of k = k ^ (x+1) -
